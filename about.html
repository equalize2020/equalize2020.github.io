        <h2>
          Our Mission
        </h2>
        <p>
          <b>Discrimination is etched into the lines of our paychecks</b>. A
          closer look at racial and gender wage gaps reveals serious problems
          with <b>intersectional workplace discrimination</b> in our societal
          structures. <br /><br />
          <b>Who you are affects how you are paid</b>. The fight for pay equity
          is an ongoing issue lacking proper awareness. <br /><br />
          In order to make strides to mend this issue, we must acknowledge that
          systemic racism lines our communities - as well as our pockets - and
          specifically targets
          <b>Black and Indigenous people, as well as other people of colour</b>.
          This racism disenfranchises individuals in their daily lives, and
          contributes to cycles of discrimination and poverty - and we want to
          change that. <br /><br />
          <b>equalize</b> is a website that displays data and reports relating
          to workplace discrimination and the wage gap. Our goal is to help
          induce change within the system by shining a light on these issues. We
          hope that our database and website spark
          <b
            >public interest and constructive discussion about the wage gap and
            workplace discrimination</b
          >. We want the workplace to change and to be a safe and equal place
          for everyone. Finally, we support marginalized communities and we will
          do our best to make their voices and stories heard.
        </p>
        <h2>
          The Wage Gap
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are serious problems in our system relating to
          <b
            >discrimination against the Black community and other racial
            minorities</b
          >. This can be seen simply by comparing the wages of people of
          different races and genders. There have been many cases where two
          people, who work the same job and hold the same position, receive
          different salaries and opportunities. In the majority of these cases,
          the person receiving the lower salary tends to be a person of a
          visible minority. Cases such as these are not uncommon and highlight
          <b
            >the importance of fighting for equality and justice in all areas of
            life, including in the workplace</b
          >. <br /><br />
          The stigma surrounding sharing salaries only contributes to racial and
          gender income inequality. Too often, we see people attach their salary
          to their self worth. Thus, revealing your salary becomes the
          equivalent of revealing who you are. equalize anonymizes reports so
          that you can share your professional experiences and learn about the
          wage gap without having to worry about your identity.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Systemic Injustices
        </h2>
        <p>
          Differences in treatment in workplace environments and differences in
          education levels due to salary disparity demonstrate how
          <b>income discrepancy fuels overall inequality</b>. The wage gap is an
          issue stemming from a combination of injustices that many minority
          groups experience. <br /><br />
          Our goal with equalize is to provide you with the information you need
          to recognize any subconscious prejudices and work towards eliminating
          them. Whether you are in a position of privilege or not, understanding
          the difference in salaries between you and your peers will allow us
          all to fight for pay equity.
